          <p>Restaurant Description
          <br><em>Taste of Fiji</em> offers an authentic and diverse array of South Pacific cuisine, with a special emphasis on dishes from the island nation of Fiji.
          Our recipes have been passed down through our family for generations. Our calamari is wild and comes from the southern coast of Viti Levu.
        Our Koru ferns are wild and are harvested from the North Island of New Zealand. In addition to traditional South Pacific food, we offer classic American cuisine and Fijian-American fusion cuisine to cater to the tastes of all our guests. We offer dine-in and carry-out options. Stop by today!</p>
